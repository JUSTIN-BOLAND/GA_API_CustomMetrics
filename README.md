# GA_API_CustomMetrics

### Custom Metrics Manager for Google Sheets

Original idea from (Simo Ahava)[https://github.com/sahava/ga-custom-dimension-manager]

Open new spreadsheet from Google Drive and create a new GApps.
In the same folder create main Code **Code.gs** and various html pages (scripts, css and html).

Before to publish as web app, remember to switch on Google Analytics API in 

_Resources > Advanced Google Services > Google Analytics API_
